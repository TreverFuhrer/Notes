- A measure of time complexity over a growing size.
- As size increases, big O is the amount of time increase

**Most Important**
1. O(1) - Constant time
	- Access by index/ hash
2. O(log N) - Logarithmic time
	- Binary search in sorted array
3. O(N) - Linear time
	- Finding item in unsorted array

**Slower Notations**
1. O(N log N) - Linearithmic
	- Merge sort or quick sort
2. O(N^2) - Quadratic
	- Bubble sort or selection sort
3. O(2^N) - Exponential
	- Finding all subsets of a set
4. O(N!) - Factorial
	- Solving traveling salesman problem exhaustively
	- *(Not sure what this is yet)*
