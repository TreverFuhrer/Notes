#### Intuition
<!-- Describe your first thoughts on how to solve this problem. -->
I initially knew it was a two pointer problem so I tried to think of a way to do it with two pointers, which was by sorting the list of nums, then getting a target using k - p1 == p2, something like that but I think I over thought it and couldnt write the code. And I saw it said hashtables in the topics so I tried to solve it with that instead.

#### Approach
<!-- Describe your approach to solving the problem. -->
Used a dictionary, adding each num to it and counted how much of each there was, so each pair was the num and how many of that num were in nums. Then I looped over the list of nums again and using the calculated target value k - num, i checked if the num and target were in the dictionary, then checked if they were the same number, if so I had to check if there was 2 of that number for me to delete or just pass. If they werent the same number then I decremented the count of num and target then added to the amount of operations.

#### Complexity
- Time complexity:
	<!-- Add your time complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

- Space complexity:
	<!-- Add your space complexity here, e.g. $$O(n)$$ -->

```python
# Code written by Trever Fuhrer
class Solution:
	def maxOperations(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
		operations = 0

		count = {}
		for num in nums:
			if num in count:
				count[num] += 1
			else:
				count[num] = 1

		for num in nums:
			target = k - num
			if count.get(num,0) > 0 and count.get(target,0) > 0:
				if num == target and count[num] < 2:
					continue
				count[num] -= 1
				count[target] -= 1
				operations += 1
		
		return operations
