```python
# Code written by Trever Fuhrer
class Solution:
	def maxVowels(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
		vowels = ['a','e','i','o','u']
		currentVowels = 0

		for i in range(k):
			if s[i] in vowels:
				currentVowels += 1
		maxVowels = currentVowels

		for i in range(k, len(s)):
			if s[i-k] in vowels:
				currentVowels -= 1
			if s[i] in vowels:
				currentVowels += 1
			maxVowels = max(maxVowels, currentVowels)

		return maxVowels
