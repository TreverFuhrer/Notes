```python
# Code written by Trever Fuhrer
class Solution:
	def canPlaceFlowers(self, flowerbed: List[int], n: int) -> bool:

		# Edge Case
		if n == 0:
			return True

		i = 0
		while n != 0 and i != len(flowerbed):
			if flowerbed[i] == 0:
				if i == 0 or flowerbed[i - 1] == 0:
					if i == len(flowerbed)-1 or flowerbed[i+1] == 0:
						flowerbed[i] = 1
						n -= 1
				if n == 0:
					return True
