I record a cast of a real into the water in a specific spot with day, weather, etc turned off. And record a long clip of it just bobbing.

Get an infinite loop bob that the cast clip can go into seamlessly.

When the user taps they pull in the reel, or maybe when the bobber goes down then you can pull in.

When u pull in your have a great chance of pulling in nothing.

But sometimes you pull a fish thats like 1.52x or 3.26x or 15.18x and thats the mutiplier of your bet and thats how much you won.

Cast anim -> bobing anim with random length then repeating every few seconds -> real in anim

maybe better odds the first time it bobs, but is hard
